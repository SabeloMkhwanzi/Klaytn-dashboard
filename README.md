### Klaytn- DEFI Dashboard
- Decentralization is one of the key aspects of blockchain technology and the entire crypto realm. As such, decentralized finance (DeFi) has been one of the most popular use cases of this disruptive technology.
- However, it is important to create platforms with user-friendly dashboards that will attract the masses to this peer-to-peer approach to decentralization finance.
- In this hackathon I have used Covalent API to Build a user friendly defi dex dashboard that displays Klaytn blockchain Assest and claimswap a Dex built on Klaytn mainnet. This was a fun project for me because I got to learn more about covalen & Klaytn during this Hackathon, and well as gain more skills
